 # Requirements

 ## Introduction
Conversion Calculator is an utility that allows user to convert unit values according to the user needs and requirement. This project is titled as **Convertion Calculator** 
 and it is developed using c language.
 when a user want to convert a value in one unit to another, user need to entre their required conversion type by entering their option shown in the menu, after that user need to enter value  to be converted, after this they will get their desired output. 

 ## Research
   ###  Advantages
        Easy and faster access
        can be used anywhere
        Future Proof

   ###   Disadvantages
        GUI is needed
        limited converstions

 ## Cost and Features
 -   EasierAccess
 -   Low Cost

## TimeLine

Problem Statement ---> Research ---> Plan --->Design --->Implement--->Testing --->Execute---> Out for Market

## Defining our System

Conversion Calculator application is so simple to use. In order to use the application, use make run command and then, you will have three options to select
And with this three converters user can convert data from one unit to othe
* LENGTH CONVERTER

* WEIGHT CONVERTER

* TEMPRATURE CONVERTER

## TOOLS USED

* GCC Compiler
* G-Edit
* GNU/GDB debugger
* C/C++ interpreter Ch 5.0

## SWOT ANALYSIS

  ![SWOT](https://github.com/vinayvanka/M1_Unit_Converter_Util/blob/main/1_Requirements/SWOT.jpg)

   ### Strengths

      We can access it from anywhere.
      It makes calculations easy.
      It is available for 24/7.
  
   ### Weaknesses

      Limeted conversions.
      Needs graphical user interface.

   ### Opportunities

      It can be used in different work places and by different needs.
      (example: calculating distance from one form to another etc.) 
      User friendly.

   ### Threats

      limited  access.



 ## 4 W's and 1 H

   ### Who
     Anyone can use this by accessing its main menu and need to choose there  required field of choice and need to enter the 
     value to get there desired output.

   ### What
     It's an unit converter utility to convert units, whic will hwpl user to converts units from one form to another form  .

   ### When
     It is available to user 24X7, 365 days without any issues and works infinite times.

   ### Where
     We can use this at different palces and this is platform independent, it will work in any platform.
     It can be used in sintefic calculators or in maths or physics labs. 
   ### How
    This application was developed in C language to avoid the complexity and to keep it simple.
